# Stats Input

The Coach is the only user that can enter stats.  The Coach is able to enter new stats, edit existing stats and delete existing stats.
The Coach, once logged in, will be able to click on a button that says Events and it will pull up a list of all Events.
The Coach can then click on an Event and if there team has already played in that Event, it will show a button saying Edit Stats.
Once the Coach clicks this button, a list of all the palyers on their team will pop up.  From here, the Coach can click on an individual player.
Under the individual player, the Coach will see three buttons, Add Stats, Edit Stats, and Delete Stats.
If the Coach clicks Add Stats, they will be able to enter new stats for that player in a text box field and when they press enter, it will populate the page and show the new stats added.
If the Coach clicks Edit Stats, they will see each stat with a clickable name and they will be able to edit whichever stat(s) that they want to by clicking on it.
If the Coach clicks Delete Stats, they will see an empty check box next to each stat name and they will be able to select whichever boxes they want to delete and then click the delete button again and it will pop up with a warning message to confirm the deletion.
